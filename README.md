Hello!! this is my very first React BIGGGG project! I made this Mini Quiz Game that guesses which character you are based on your choices and personality. It was really really really a challenge for me to make this BUT GAHHH ATLAST it works!!! YAYAYAYA IM SO HAPPYY! i also deployed it on Vercel (WHICH TOOK 2 HOURS) (But again, atleast it was worth it) in our project guidlines, it was advised to use API's to fetch the results data, but I couldn't find one so I just personalised some of my own T-T (took alot of research) and i also learnt so so so many new things while making this, I learnt how to make color variables in CSS, learnt logic formation in React better, and also learnt how to Deploy you web app with vercel!! a win win haha i hope. I hope you had fun playing this silly game... it took me alot of time so im kinda nervous. Oh and yeah i also designed the UI layout myself! (tho its very simple ahaha...)
